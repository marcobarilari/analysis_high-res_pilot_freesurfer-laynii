# Source code

In this repo we get layers from the MP2RAGE upsampled to 0.375 mm iso

Steps:

1. Get bias field corrected image from SPM segmentation output
2. Run Freesurfer recon-all for high-res data
3. Get layers with LAYNII
## Get bias field corrected image from SPM segmentation output

Code in `spm_segmentation` folder, this uses `cpp_spm` pipeline

## Run Freesurfer recon-all for high-res data

TODO:
- [ ] implement parallelization
